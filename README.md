# Canvas LMS MCP Server for Claude

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects Claude to Canvas LMS, letting you manage your coursework through natural conversation.

**Ask Claude things like:**
- "What assignments do I have due this week?"
- "Show me the rubric for my essay assignment"
- "What did my professor say in the feedback?"
- "List all my courses"
- "Are there any overdue assignments?"

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Canvas API Token

1. Log in to Canvas
2. Click your **profile picture** → **Settings**
3. Scroll to **Approved Integrations**
4. Click **+ New Access Token**
5. Name it (e.g., "Claude") and click **Generate Token**
6. **Copy the token** - you won't see it again!

### 2. Install the MCP Server

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/lucanardinocchi/canvas-mcp.git
cd canvas-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop

Open Claude Desktop's config file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add (or merge) this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canvas": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/FULL/PATH/TO/canvas-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "CANVAS_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
        "CANVAS_BASE_URL": "https://your-school.instructure.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Replace:**
- `/FULL/PATH/TO/canvas-mcp` with the actual path where you cloned this repo
- `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your Canvas API token
- `https://your-school.instructure.com` with your Canvas URL

**Common Canvas URLs:**
| University | Canvas URL |
|------------|------------|
| University of Sydney | `https://canvas.sydney.edu.au` |
| Generic Instructure | `https://canvas.instructure.com` |
| Your school | Check your browser when logged into Canvas |

### 4. Restart Claude Desktop

Quit Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q / Alt+F4) and reopen it.

You should now see Canvas tools available in Claude!

## Troubleshooting

### "Canvas tools not showing up"
1. Make sure you restarted Claude Desktop completely
2. Check that the path in your config is correct
3. Verify your `claude_desktop_config.json` is valid JSON

### "401 Unauthorized" errors
Your API token is invalid or expired. Generate a new one in Canvas settings.

### "403 Forbidden" errors
You don't have access to that resource. The course may have ended, or you're not enrolled.

### "Connection refused" or network errors
Check that your `CANVAS_BASE_URL` is correct (no trailing slash).

---

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Keep your API token secret!**
- Never commit your token to git
- Don't share your token with others
- Set an expiration date when creating tokens
- Revoke tokens you no longer use (Canvas Settings → Approved Integrations)

Your API token has the same access as your Canvas account - anyone with it can view your grades, submit assignments, etc.
