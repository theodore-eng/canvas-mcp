# Canvas MCP — Connect Claude to Canvas LMS

An MCP server that gives Claude full access to your Canvas LMS coursework. Ask about grades, deadlines, feedback, and more through natural conversation.

**Works with any university that uses Canvas** (Instructure). Just plug in your API token and school URL.

**Ask Claude things like:**
- "Give me my daily briefing"
- "What assignments do I have due this week?"
- "What grade do I need on the final to get an A?"
- "What did my professor say in the feedback?"
- "What's my grade in each class?"
- "Add a reminder to my planner for Friday"

---

## Setup (3 minutes)

### 1. Get Your Canvas API Token

1. Log in to Canvas
2. Click your **profile picture** → **Settings**
3. Scroll to **Approved Integrations**
4. Click **+ New Access Token**
5. Name it (e.g., "Claude") and click **Generate Token**
6. **Copy the token** — you won't see it again!

### 2. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucanardinocchi/canvas-mcp.git
cd canvas-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

### 3. Add to Claude Desktop

Open Claude Desktop's config file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add this (or merge into existing config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canvas": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/FULL/PATH/TO/canvas-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "CANVAS_API_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
        "CANVAS_BASE_URL": "https://your-school.instructure.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Replace:**
- `/FULL/PATH/TO/canvas-mcp` — the folder where you cloned this repo
- `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` — your Canvas API token from step 1
- `https://your-school.instructure.com` — your school's Canvas URL (check your browser URL bar when logged in)

### 4. Restart Claude Desktop

Quit completely (Cmd+Q / Alt+F4) and reopen. You should see Canvas tools available.

## What Can It Do?

### Daily Briefing
One command to see everything: today's events, upcoming deadlines, recent grades, announcements, and todo items. Just ask *"Give me my daily briefing"*.

### Grade Intelligence
- Current grades across all courses with letter grade breakdowns
- "What-if" grade calculator — see how future scores affect your grade
- Target grade calculator — find out what score you need on an assignment to hit your goal
- Grade deflation detection via class statistics

### Planner & Deadlines
- View your Canvas planner with all items organized by date
- Create personal reminders and notes
- Get upcoming work across all courses in one view
- Scan for untracked work (readings, prep) that doesn't show up as assignments

### Content & Search
- Read module content, pages, files, and announcements
- Search across all courses at once
- Browse course files and extract text from PDFs, Word docs, etc.
- Read discussion boards and conversation threads

### Prompt Templates
Pre-built workflows available as slash commands in Claude:
- `/weekly_review` — Comprehensive weekly coursework review
- `/study_plan` — Create a study plan for an exam or topic

## Safety & Write Permissions

### Always On (Safe)
- **All read operations** — courses, grades, assignments, files, etc.
- **Planner notes** — create/update/delete personal reminders (only visible to you)
- **Mark items complete** — personal planner tracking
- **Preferences** — save personal notes and context locally

### Opt-In Write Tools (ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS=true)
Disabled by default. To enable, add to your config:
```json
"env": {
  "CANVAS_API_TOKEN": "...",
  "CANVAS_BASE_URL": "...",
  "ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS": "true"
}
```

When enabled:
- `submit_assignment` — Submit text or URL to an assignment
- `upload_file` — Upload a file for submission
- `post_discussion_entry` — Post to a discussion
- `reply_to_discussion` — Reply to a discussion post

All write tools include explicit warnings so Claude knows these actions are visible to instructors.

## Troubleshooting

### "Canvas tools not showing up"
1. Restart Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q / Alt+F4, then reopen)
2. Check that the path in your config points to `dist/index.js`
3. Verify `claude_desktop_config.json` is valid JSON (no trailing commas)

### "401 Unauthorized"
Your API token is invalid or expired. Generate a new one in Canvas Settings → Approved Integrations.

### "403 Forbidden"
You don't have access to that resource. Some courses restrict API access to files or pages — the server automatically falls back to module scanning when this happens.

### "Connection refused"
Check that `CANVAS_BASE_URL` is correct with no trailing slash.

---

## Security

**Keep your API token secret!**
- Never commit your token to git
- Don't share it with anyone
- Set an expiration date when creating tokens
- Revoke unused tokens in Canvas Settings → Approved Integrations

Your API token has the same access as your Canvas account.
